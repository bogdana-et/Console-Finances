# Console-Finances

## Description

The aim of this project was to create a financial analysis tool using javascript. This can be applied in order to analyse company financial records, for example. 
I had to calculate things such as total of the profits and losses together, the average total of profits and losses, and the greatest increase and decrease of profits and losses, using the data in the array. 
I learned how to use a for loop with if statements inside of, and it helped me get into a problem-solving mindset.
